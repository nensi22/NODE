    <--> Math.pow()
            The Math.pow() method returns the value of a base raised to a power.

            A number representing base taken to the power of exponent. Returns NaN in one of the following cases:
                * exponent is NaN.
                * base is NaN and exponent is not 0.
                * base is ±1 and exponent is ±Infinity.
                * base < 0 and exponent is not an integer.

            Syntax  :=
                    Math.pow(base, exponent)

            Example :=
                    Math.pow(2, 10);                                //          1024
