<--> Math.random()
            The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that's greater than or 
            equal to 0 and less than 1, with approximately uniform distribution over that range â€” which you can 
            then scale to your desired range. The implementation selects the initial seed to the random number 
            generation algorithm; it cannot be chosen or reset by the user.

            Syntax  :=
                    Math.random()

            Example :=
                    console.log(Math.random());                 //      0.8396194832450654
                    
                    console.log(Math.random()*33);              //      8.442579392089893
