                That is why, after hearing this transcendental discourse of Lord Krishna, Arjuna exclaims to Him, “O Achyuta
                (The Changeless One), my delusion is destroyed, and my memory (about one’s true identity) has been
                regained by me through Your grace. I am firmly situated; my doubts are gone. I will now act according to
                Your word.”

                 The Bhagavad Gita is not a religious book and is not intended to be read and acted upon by the adherents
                 of a particular religion. It’s a guidebook for life; a how-to manual. It is a medicine for the infected souls of the
                 Kali-Yuga, the dark age. And there is no religion in medicine.

                 The Bhagavad Gita is the most sacred conversation ever between Lord Krishna and his friend Prince Arjuna
                 just before the beginning of the great war of Mahabharata, on the holy battlefield of Kurukshetra, where the
                 Lord enlightens a bewildered Arjuna about the biggest truths of the universe.
